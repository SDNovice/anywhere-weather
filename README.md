Anywhere weather was design with the intent to be able to pull the forecast for future
events as well as the current weather. When a city is entered it will present the date, 
the city, an icon of the weather condition, the temp, humidity and windspeed and save 
that result as a button for the user to return to visit if needed.

## Usage
